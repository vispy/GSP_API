- gsp_network to specify the scene renderer on a remote server
  - easier to test
- datoviz network doesnt work as it is unable to take screenshots
- Complete serialisation/deserialization for all visuals
- DONE pdf/svg output for matplotlib
- DONE do something multi viewport
- DONE do serialisation with json
- DONE do network with http
- do test with expected_screenshots
- do a 'big tester' example
  - something with arguments which can be changed from command line
  - thus it can be intrumented to cover all the cases in combinations
  - multi-viewports
  - with and without serialisation
  - with and without http server
  - all visuals - various scenes
  - all renderers
  - using transform or buffer as input
- API design principles
  - "what are the good design principle to apply when designing an library API"

- to get the screen type on macosx
  - `system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType`
  - `system_profiler SPHardwareDataType`
- PR datoviz with the whole ./datoviz as pyright 0 errors
  - add a pyright target in justfile
- test dynamic group in datoviz pixels
- datoviz: add better python API (seems hard/complicated to do)
- when datoviz core dump, DVZ_LOG_LEVEL=0
  - when creating a datoviz app with 350 pixelds visual, there is a segfault
- handle the animation loop
  - with decorator like datoviz? yes
  - API from datoviz
  - API from matplotlib
  - GSP API common
- transformChain
  - with depth color
  - aka with renderer events
- transformChain with unit conversions - can this be done in user-space
  - data in ndc by default
  - operation with scalar with unit pt/px/cm/inch
  - dpi canvas - === ppi on screen, dpi on print
  - dpi === PPI
  - in the transform chain, have a user data which store the current viewport size in px, and dpi
  - MathOpsLink (opts, scalar, units) in usespace
    - op_code
    - scalar_value (in input buffer_type)
    - scalar_unit
  - how to pass the canvas to the transform chain?
    - can this be done in userspace
    - possibility: set by class or by instance

- DONE implement points in datoviz
- WONTDO for each example, `_matplotlib` `_datoviz` and `_both`
  - have a test_runner ?
- PR for datoviz
  - DONE issue on n_groups missing in .paths() constructor
  - DONE issue of static type checking in .segments() cap
  - DONE add test layers (with visual regression)
- DONE code segments - matplotlib + datoviz
  - positions is [start, end]*n
  - color rgba8 * n
  - line_width float32 * n
  - cap: butt, round, square
- DONE implement path in matplotlib + datoviz
  - issue to mix the multiple paths and the groups attributes

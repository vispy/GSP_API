- transformChain
  - with depth color
  - aka with renderer events
- transformChain with unit conversions - can this be done in user-space
  - data in ndc by default
  - operation with scalar with unit pt/px/cm/inch
  - dpi canvas - === ppi on screen, dpi on print
  - in the transform chain, have a user data which store the current viewport size in px, and dpi
  - MathOpsLink (opts, scalar, units) in usespace
    - op_code
    - scalar_value (in input buffer_type)
    - scalar_unit
  - how to pass the canvas to the transform chain?
    - can this be done in userspace
    - possibility: set by class or by instance
- PR datoviz with the whole ./datoviz as pyright 0 errors
  - add a pyright target in justfile
- test dynamic group in datoviz pixels
- datoviz: add better python API (seems hard/complicated to do)
- when datoviz core dump, DVZ_LOG_LEVEL=0
  - when creating a datoviz app with 350 pixel, there is a segfault
- handle the animation loop
  - with decorator like datoviz? yes
  - API from datoviz
  - API from matplotlib
  - GSP API common



---
- DONE implement points in datoviz
- WONTDO for each example, `_matplotlib` `_datoviz` and `_both`
  - have a test_runner ?
- PR for datoviz
  - DONE issue on n_groups missing in .paths() constructor
  - DONE issue of static type checking in .segments() cap
  - DONE add test layers (with visual regression)
- DONE code segments - matplotlib + datoviz
  - positions is [start, end]*n
  - color rgba8 * n
  - line_width float32 * n
  - cap: butt, round, square
- DONE implement path in matplotlib + datoviz
  - issue to mix the multiple paths and the groups attributes

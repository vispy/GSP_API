- about porting pyramid
  - sub sample data to make it addable on github data (aka less 2gb limit)
- rewrite all the docstrings to follow numpydoc style
  - https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html
  - document all functions/member/types public to the class
- GSP doc
  - concise
  - resume of the existing white paper

- basic for vispy 2.0 - minimal - all in GSP
  - in src/gsp_vispy2
  - imgshow, scatter
- record a session with matplotlib + camera controls + animator
  - in the animator callback, get all the rendering _args, in a file with timestamps
  - then write a player of this gsp_session.json file
  - session_recorder.py
  - session_player.py
- transform mvp for all visual in datoviz
  - how to test that
  - in big_tester ?
- support texts in datoviz
  - identify what is wrong/missing
  - write datoviz tests
- get other visual API for the hollyday
- transform chain + viewport unit conversion in .userData
  - MathOpUnit link
    - op_code: add/sub/mul/div
    - scalar_value: float32
    - scalar_unit: enum (ndc, px, cm, inch, pt)
  - All in user space
- how to leverage big_tester ? 
  - do i use it in a test suite ? or just as an example ?
  - what about having a big_tester_test.py which use it as a test suite and generate many cases
  - `big_tester_example.py` as an example
  - `big_tester_cmdline.py` as a test suite
- RECORD + REPLAY
  - MG4: GSP video recording (Q4). We will provide a Python example showing how to record a live interactive visualization 
    video by saving the timestamped emitted GSP commands to a file, and replaying them in real time on another computer.
- handle 3d rotation in datoviz
  - how to handle that ? maybe i set it up to orthographic camera
  - dvz.visual_mvp(c_visual, mvp_pointer_to_48_float32)
  - you need to concatenate the 3 mat4

- test dynamic group in datoviz pixels
- transformChain
  - with depth color
  - aka with renderer events
- example of transformChain + unit conversion
  - assume the canvas DPI is the screen one
  - example: draw an axis with ticks every 1 cm using segments 
  - multiple viewports
  - redrawn on resize
  - axis at 10px margin from the border
  - ticks every 1cm
- transformChain with unit conversions - can this be done in user-space
  - data in ndc by default - aka -1 to 1 in current viewport
  - operation with scalar with unit pt/px/cm/inch
    - pt - point - 1/72 inch
    - cm - centimeter
    - inch - inch
    - px - pixel - screen pixel - ppi pre device-pixel-ratio
  - dpi canvas - === ppi on screen, dpi on print
  - dpi === PPI
  - in the transform chain, have a user data which store the current viewport size in px, and dpi
  - MathOpsLink (opts, scalar, units) in usespace
    - op_code
    - scalar_value (in input buffer_type)
    - scalar_unit
  - how to pass the canvas to the transform chain?
    - can this be done in userspace
    - possibility: set by class or by instance

  - viewport is always used in ndc
    - +- X pixel (pre device pixel ratio)
    - +- X cm
  - so need to convert pixel to viewport-ndc
  - so need to convert cm to viewport-ndc
  - i got the canvas size in pixel and in cm
    - viewport size in pixel (so i can get viewport size in cm)
    - so i got a canvas/viewport ratio
  - so i add the cm/pixel to viewport-ndc

# Trying to figure out the DPI/PPI mess
screen size in 
- millimeter
- hw pixel
- logical pixel

-  'from there find the formula for the other paramters' as a next steps

the point is to get the minimal parmeters
- then find the formula to get the other parameters
- we need to progress slowly to be sure we understand/agree those concepts

i dont see anything so hard, just messy
